They can be run at any time (and any number of times), but they will
give the most complete and accurate results when run after the top of the hour,
looking back on hours with readings that are "complete".

You can adjust or remove the `AND date_trunc` part of the WHERE clause to adjust how far back the query will go

You could e.g. use cron to run hourly at ten minutes after:

```
# m h  dom mon dow   command
10 * * * * echo "select wm_update_hourly_summaries();" | psql -h localhost -U username -d database
```

A `~/.pgpass` file can be used to store the password for psql
